# Web Development 3 - Laravel Application

## Project idea

This project is a blog about interesting places in Eindhoven.


### We are using Less

The project uses LESS as a CSS pre-processor. Read more about LESS: http://lesscss.org/

### Authorization

We have three-level authorization;
1. **Admin**
: Login: admin@admin.com, Password: admin
2. **User**
: Login: user@user.com, Password: user
3. **Guest**
: No login

Admin can **CRUD** all content

User can **CRU** content

Guest can **R** content

##### Pixelate

Pixelate **works**, but only if you add a new image to a blog post,
because with default images, we don't have pixelated copies.

#### **Group members:**

Jenna Ahokas and Susanna Hyötyläinen
